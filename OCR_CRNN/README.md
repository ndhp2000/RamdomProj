# OCR using CRNN architecture

At first I want to build my own OCR system but I got bored soon after find out writing architecture is not hard and CTC decoder could be written with a max function and a simple function to remove blanks and duplicates. So this one maybe a draft forever. 

In notebook I train with MNIST dataset (toy). Easy to get 92% acc, actually when resize img to 32x32 it can reach 99%.
